                   POI Release Checklist
             ================================

Note - this file should be read in conjunction with the 
 POI Release Guide. They should probably be merged in future...

- ensure the changelog is up to date
- tag SVN
- build distributions as if it was the final release
- update any filename dates from today's date, to the date that the
   vote will end (typically 7 days time)
- copy the -redirect pom to a subdirectory of redirect/, and remove
   -redirect from its name
- sign and checksum distributions as per
    http://www.apache.org/dev/mirror-step-by-step.html
- upload the files to the POI dev dist area under /<version>-RC-<x>/
    eg https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/poi/3.8-RC2/ for
    3.8 Release Candidate 2 
- add a README.txt to the directory that states the files are a
   release candidate pending a vote, despite their name being -FINAL
- include the URL of this in the release vote (goes to dev, not user)
   (eg https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/poi/3.8-RC2/)
