    <section><title>Overview</title>
      <p>Apache POI provides text extraction for all the supported file
       formats. In addition, it provides access to the metadata
       associated with a given file, such as title and author.</p>
      <p>In addition to providing direct text extraction classes,
       POI works closely with the 
       <link href="http://incubator.apache.org/tika/">Apache Tika</link>
       text extraction library. Users may wish to simply utilise 
       the functionality provided by Tika.</p>
    </section>

    <section><title>Common functionality</title>
     <p>All of the POI text extractors extend from
      <em>org.apache.poi.POITextExtractor</em>. This provides a common
      method across all extractors, getText(). For many cases, the text
      returned will be all you need. However, many extractors do provide
      more targetted text extraction methods, so you may wish to use
      these in some cases.</p>
     <p>All POIFS / OLE 2 based text extractors also extend from
      <em>org.apache.poi.POIOLE2TextExtractor</em>. This additionally
      provides common methods to get at the <link href="hpfs/">HPFS
      document metadata</link>.</p>
     <p>All OOXML based text extractors (available in POI 3.5 and later) 
      also extend from
      <em>org.apache.poi.POIOOXMLTextExtractor</em>. This additionally
      provides common methods to get at the OOXML metadata.</p>
    </section>

    <section><title>Text Extractor Factory - POI 3.5 or later</title>
     <p>A new class in POI 3.5, 
      <em>org.apache.poi.extractor.ExtractorFactory</em> provides a
      similar function to WorkbookFactory. You simply pass it an
      InputStream, a file, a POIFSFileSystem or a OOXML Package. It
      figures out the correct text extractor for you, and returns it.</p>
    </section>

    <section><title>Excel</title>
     <p>For .xls files, there is 
      <em>org.apache.poi.hssf.extractor.ExcelExtractor</em>, which will 
      return text, optionally with formulas instead of their contents. 
      Those using POI 3.5 can also use 
      <em>org.apache.poi.xssf.extractor.XSSFExcelExtractor</em>, to perform
      a similar task for .xlsx files.</p>
     <p>In addition, there is a second text extractor for .xls files,
      <em>org.apache.poi.hssf.extractor.EventBasedExcelExtractor</em>. This
      is based on the streaming EventUserModel code, and will generally
      deliver a lower memory footprint for extraction. However, it will
      have problems correctly outputting more complex formulas, as it 
      works with records as they pass, and so doesn't have access to all
      parts of complex and shared formulas.</p>
    </section>

    <section><title>Word</title>
     <p>For .doc files from Word 97 - Word 2003, in scratchpad there is 
      <em>org.apache.poi.hwpf.extractor.WordExtractor</em>, which will 
      return text for your document.</p>
     <p>Those using POI 3.7 can also extract simple textual content from
      older Word 6 and Word 95 files, using the scratchpad class
      <em>org.apache.poi.hwpf.extractor.Word6Extractor</em>.</p>
     <p>Since POI 3.5, it is possible to use
      <em>org.apache.poi.xwpf.extractor.XPFFWordExtractor</em>, to perform
      text extraction for .docx files.</p> 
    </section>

    <section><title>PowerPoint</title>
     <p>For .ppt files, in scratchpad there is 
      <em>org.apache.poi.hslf.extractor.PowerPointExtractor</em>, which 
      will return text for your slideshow, optionally restricted to just
      slides text or notes text. Those using POI 3.5 can also use 
      <em>org.apache.poi.xslf.extractor.XSLFPowerPointExtractor</em>, to 
      perform a similar task for .pptx files.</p>
    </section>

    <section><title>Publisher</title>
     <p>For .pub files, in scratchpad there is 
      <em>org.apache.poi.hpbf.extractor.PublisherExtractor</em>, which 
      will return text for your file.</p>
    </section>

    <section><title>Visio</title>
     <p>For .vsd files, in scratchpad there is 
      <em>org.apache.poi.hdgf.extractor.VisioTextExtractor</em>, which 
      will return text for your file.</p>
    </section>

    <section><title>Embedded Objects</title>
      <p>Extractors already exist for Excel, Word, PowerPoint and Visio; 
        if one of these objects is embedded into a worksheet, the ExtractorFactory class can be used to recover an extractor for it.     
      </p>
      <source>
FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(inputFile);
POIFSFileSystem fileSystem = new POIFSFileSystem(fis);
// Firstly, get an extractor for the Workbook
POIOLE2TextExtractor oleTextExtractor = 
   ExtractorFactory.createExtractor(fileSystem);
// Then a List of extractors for any embedded Excel, Word, PowerPoint
// or Visio objects embedded into it.
POITextExtractor[] embeddedExtractors =
   ExtractorFactory.getEmbededDocsTextExtractors(oleTextExtractor);
for (POITextExtractor textExtractor : embeddedExtractors) {
   // If the embedded object was an Excel spreadsheet.
   if (textExtractor instanceof ExcelExtractor) {
      ExcelExtractor excelExtractor = (ExcelExtractor) textExtractor;
      System.out.println(excelExtractor.getText());
   }
   // A Word Document
   else if (textExtractor instanceof WordExtractor) {
      WordExtractor wordExtractor = (WordExtractor) textExtractor;
      String[] paragraphText = wordExtractor.getParagraphText();
      for (String paragraph : paragraphText) {
         System.out.println(paragraph);
      }
      // Display the document's header and footer text
      System.out.println("Footer text: " + wordExtractor.getFooterText());
      System.out.println("Header text: " + wordExtractor.getHeaderText());
   }
   // PowerPoint Presentation.
   else if (textExtractor instanceof PowerPointExtractor) {
      PowerPointExtractor powerPointExtractor =
         (PowerPointExtractor) textExtractor;
      System.out.println("Text: " + powerPointExtractor.getText());
      System.out.println("Notes: " + powerPointExtractor.getNotes());
   }
   // Visio Drawing
   else if (textExtractor instanceof VisioTextExtractor) {
      VisioTextExtractor visioTextExtractor = 
         (VisioTextExtractor) textExtractor;
      System.out.println("Text: " + visioTextExtractor.getText());
   }
