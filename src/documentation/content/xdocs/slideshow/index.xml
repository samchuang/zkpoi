            <p>HSLF is the POI Project's pure Java implementation of the 
			Powerpoint '97(-2007) file format. It <em>does not</em> support
			the new PowerPoint 2007 .pptx file format, which is not OLE2 
			based.</p>
    <p>HSLF provides a way to read, create or modify PowerPoint  presentations. In particular, it provides:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>api for data extraction (text, pictures, embedded objects, sounds)</li>
                <li>usermodel api for creating, reading and modifying ppt files</li>
            </ul>
            <note> 
                This code currently lives the 
                <link href="http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/poi/trunk/src/scratchpad/">scratchpad area</link> 
                of the POI SVN repository. 
				Ensure that you have the scratchpad jar or the scratchpad 
                build area in your classpath before experimenting with 
                this code - the main POI jar is not enough.
			</note>
			<p>The <link href="./quick-guide.html">quick guide</link> documentation provides 
            information on using this API. Comments and fixes gratefully accepted on the POI
            dev mailing lists.</p>
